// Copy constructor

/* Copy constructor is a constructor which creates an object by initializing it with an object of the same class,
 * which has been created previously.
 * The copy constructor is used to:
    	- Initialize one object from another of the same type.
    	- Copy an object to pass it as an argument to a function.
    	- Copy an object to return it from a function.
    If a copy constructor is not defined in a class, the compiler itself defines one.
    If the class has pointer variables and has some dynamic memory allocations, then it is a must to have a copy constructor.
